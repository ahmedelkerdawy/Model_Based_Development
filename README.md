# 🚀 Model-Based Development (MBD) Projects

Welcome to my Model-Based Development (MBD) repository! This space showcases hands-on projects using MATLAB, Simulink, and Embedded Coder to build real-world embedded systems through simulation, modeling, and auto code generation.

## 🔧 What You'll Find Here

- ✅ System-level Simulink models
- ✅ Control system design using PID and Stateflow
- ✅ Auto-generated C code for embedded deployment
- ✅ SCADA integration and real-time interfacing
- ✅ BMS, robotics, and sensor-based applications

## 🌱 Why This Repo?

Model-Based Design helps bridge the gap between **simulation and real implementation** — ideal for rapid prototyping, design validation, and production code generation. This repo demonstrates how I apply those techniques to create intelligent, self-driving systems and smart embedded applications.

## 🎯 Target Audience

This repository is perfect for:
- Engineering students exploring control systems & embedded design
- Anyone preparing for automotive or embedded software roles
- Curious minds looking to understand the **end-to-end MBD workflow**

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- MATLAB & Simulink
- Stateflow
- Embedded Coder
- Arduino & Raspberry Pi
- GitHub for version control

## 📌 Projects in Progress

- 🚜 **Self-driving robot with obstacle detection**
- 🧪 **Soil NPK sensor integration**
- 🔋 **Battery Management System (BMS) modeling**
- 🧠 **SCADA logic with real-time feedback**
